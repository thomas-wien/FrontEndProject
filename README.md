CodeFactory Alumni website

For this project, you will need to build CodeFactory’s Alumni website.

What we need: The alumni website should consist of five sections: Home page, Alumni directory, Stories, Careers and Events. The purpose of the website is to give all necessary information about alumni, like:

    Alumni information

    Success stories

    Career opportunities

    Events at CodeFactory or somewhere else that can be interesting for alumni



Requirements: Website must be fully responsive (you are allowed to use 100% free theme elements if they are without any copyrighted restrictions and of course you must implement them in combination with your styles - using just prepared theme without your styles is not allowed). Alumni directory should have a list of all alumni, their name and photo and when the user clicks on the specific profile should get information about alumni’s career as well as information about the achievements during the studies at CodeFactory. Stories is a page with success stories of alumni’s. Page Careers must have articles about job opportunities as well as information about companies that are interested in employing alumnis. Events page must have dates of events as well as all necessary information about the event like: type of event, date, location. The home page should be present most popular information of pages Stories, Careers and Events as well as give the information about the page purpose.
